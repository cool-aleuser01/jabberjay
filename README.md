> Jabberjays are a type of muttation that consist of all male birds that were created in the Capitol labs to spy on enemies and rebels of the Capitol. Jabberjays had the ability to memorize and repeat entire human conversations, and were used as spies, to gather words and information. - The Hunger Games

**Jabberjay** is a Clojure micro-framework for creating Jabber bots.

Programming your own Jabber bot can be helpful and fun.
You can use your Jabber bot to provide information about some running systems or to make your services interact with users.


## Configuration

Default configuration is stored in project resources (config.edn) in [EDN format](https://github.com/edn-format/edn):
```edn
{:jabber {:username "Fill me up!"
          :password "Fill me up!"
          :host "Fill me up!"
          :domain "Fill me up!"}
 :watchdog {:folder "scripts"
            :delay 1000}}
```

Before using, it is necessary to configure the following parameters:
* :username (ex: "jabberjay@gmail.com")
* :password (ex: "iddqd")
* :host (ex: "talk.google.com")
* :domain (ex: "gmail.com")

It is also possbile to use user-base configuration file, which should be located in `~/jabberjay.edn`.
All parameters from this file override default config parameters.


## Development

TODO


## Building from source

To build executable JAR from sources:
